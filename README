Description:

Epgfixer is a VDR plugin for doing extra fixing of EPG data. Everything is
done using regular expressions. Correctly named back references are placed
to the named EPG field.

Plugin also has EPG bug fixes included in VDR individually selectable from
setup menu.

Requirements:
 - VDR 1.7.26 or later
 - PCRE

Usage:

General syntax of configuration files:
- Lines beginning with # are regarded as comments.
- Lines beginning with ! are regarded as disabled lines.
- Channel_list is optional comma separated list of channels for which the line
  is used. If no list of channels is given the line is used for all channels.
- Channel_list can contain either channel IDs (e.g. S19.2E-1-1089-12003-0) or
  numbers but not both.

All regular expressions are placed to VDRPLUGINCONFDIR/epgfixer/regexp.conf.

Syntax of regexp.conf line is "Channel_list:Parsed_epg_field=Regexp" with:
- Parsed_epg_field is the EPG field for which the regular expression is applied
  with available field names title, shorttext and description.
- Regular expressions use named backreferences with either title, shorttext,
  description or rating (parental rating).
- By prepending "a" or "p" to backreference name (except rating field) the
  back referenced string is either appended or prepended to the original
  content of the target EPG field, respectively.
- Several regular expressions may be applied to same field.

All character set conversions are placed to 
VDRPLUGINCONFDIR/epgfixer/charset.conf.

Syntax of charset.conf line is "Channel_list:OriginalCharSet" with:
- OriginalCharSet is a name of a character set (e.g. iso8859-1).

Examples of regexp.conf:

# Example of disabled regexp:
!title=^(?:Movie: |Document: )(?<title>.*)$

# Remove "Movie: " or "Document: " from the beginning of title field for 
# channels 1, 3 and 5:
1,3,5:title=^(?:Movie: |Document: )(?<title>.*)$

# Move parental rating from end of title to correct EPG field:
# Program title (12)
title=^(?<title>.*)[ ][(](?<rating>[0-9S]{1,2})[)][ ]*$


Examples of charset.conf:

# Convert character set of channels 1, 2 and 3 from iso8859-1 to character set
# used by VDR
1,2,3:iso8859-1

# Convert character set of all channels from iso8859-1 to character set 
# used by VDR
iso8859-1
