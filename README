Description:

Epgfixer is a VDR plugin for doing extra fixing of EPG data.

Features:

- Modifying EPG data using regular expressions. Correctly named back references
  are placed to the named EPG field.
- Character set conversions for channel using incorrect encoding.
- Both regular expressions and character set conversions can be applied to 
  either all channels or only to selected channels.
- Editing regular expressions and character set conversions through setup menu.
- EPG bug fixes included in VDR individually selectable from
  setup menu.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-epgfixer-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s epgfixer-X.Y.Z epgfixer
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
cp -R PLUGINS/src/epgfixer/epgfixer /path/to/vdrconf/plugins/
make
make plugins
./vdr -P epgfixer

Configuration:

Regular expressions and character set conversions are defined in regexp.conf
and charset.conf, respectively, located in VDR's configuration directory for
plugins. Check the example configuration files under "epgfixer" subdirectory
for further information.

General syntax of configuration files:
- Lines beginning with # are regarded as comments.
- Lines beginning with ! are regarded as disabled lines.
- Channel_list is optional comma separated list of channels for which the line
  is used. If no list of channels is given the line is used for all channels.
- Channel_list can contain either channel IDs (e.g. S19.2E-1-1089-12003-0) or
  numbers but not both.

Syntax of regexp.conf line is "Channel_list:Parsed_epg_field=Regexp" with:
- Parsed_epg_field is the EPG field for which the regular expression is applied
  with available field names title, shorttext and description.
- Regular expressions use named backreferences with either title, shorttext,
  description or rating (parental rating).
- By prepending "a" or "p" to backreference name (except rating field) the
  back referenced string is either appended or prepended to the original
  content of the target EPG field, respectively.
- Several regular expressions may be applied to same field.

Syntax of charset.conf line is "Channel_list:OriginalCharSet" with:
- OriginalCharSet is a name of a character set (e.g. iso8859-1).
